## Collections Framework

### What Is a Collections Framework
A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections.<br />

The core collection interfaces encapsulate different types of collections (a collection sometimes called a container ):
- Collection interface (java.util.Collection) <br />
A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. <br />
Java platform doesn't provide any direct implementations of this interface but provides implementations of more specific subinterfaces, such as Set and List. <br />
  * Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
  * List: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
  * Queue
  * Deque
- Map interface (java.util.Map) <br />
An object that maps keys to values.
  * HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable, Properties
